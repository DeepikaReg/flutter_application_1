## Summary and Reflection

As per the given steps from the professor and online resources(youtube),I have installed Flutter SDK and configured accordingly with VScode on my system.
Additionally I have installed Android Studio and downloaded the SDKS for the required emulator.

I created a new flutter project "flutter_application_1" which is a basic flutter application and I have pushed the code to my repository. https://github.com/DeepikaReg/flutter_application_1/tree/main
I made the required updates to "REPORT.md" and pushed it to github.
All the while,I felt the process was a bit complex and faced some issues as this was my first time working with Mobile Application Development(CS442),but I found it to be interesting and could definetely sought more ways to further explore the subject. 
I completed Self-Evaluation Checklist.
